# Kyowa-pository
Today's new repository, my second so far.
Bad pun: doesn't even properly refer to the famous "r <-> l" slip up
that Japanese speakers often make...
Edited using vi, a klutsy, unintuitive text editor--- that we will have to learn.

(I suppose intuition comes with practice...)

OTOH, I could just do all my editing using the GitHub GUI.
This is edited there. I will probably need to learn how to use vi as well,
but this is the easiest way, at least at the moment.

I suppose it's useful to be able to edit using vi if absolutely necessary
("Captain... what is this C: prompt??"), but try and use the most efficient GUI
when possible. This comment added using github.com's GUI, to be pulled back to local
